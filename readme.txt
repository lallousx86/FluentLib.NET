lallouslab's FluentLib .NET
===========================

FluentLib is a set of libraries that provide library extensions, WinForms controls extensions, utility functions and what not.
With FluentLib, all the redundant tasks are hidden away and nicely abstracted so you focus on your applications' functionality rather than the mundate supporting functionality.
